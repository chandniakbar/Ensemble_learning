# Ensemble_learning
ensemble learning by using 3 models (KNN, random forest and logistic regression)
The purpose of ensemble model is to integrate different model to enhance the overall accuracy and performance of model. 
Averaging method: Usually combined model is better than the indiviual model. There are 2 types of averaging method i.e.
1) Bagging method
2) Random Forest method
In boosting methods, base estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. 
The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.
Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting, â€¦
